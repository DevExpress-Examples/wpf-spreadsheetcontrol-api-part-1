# WPF SpreadsheetControl API - Part 1

This example demonstrates how to use the SpreadsheetControl API to manage spreadsheet documents in code, without the need for Microsoft Excel to be installed. 

Double-click the action name in the Navigation Bar to run the code that illustrates the API functionality. The results are shown in the SpreadsheetControl and saved to the _SavedDocument.xlsx_ file in the Document subfolder of the working folder.

In particular, this sample introduces API used to perform the following operations:
* Manage worksheets (activate, create, delete, rename, copy, adjust worksheet view, etc.)
* Manipulate rows and columns (insert, delete, copy rows and columns, adjust row height and column width, etc.)
* Manipulate cells and cell ranges (set cell values, add hyperlinks to cells, copy and merge cells), create, edit and copy cell comments
* Create formulas (use various functions and cell references in formulas, use names in formulas, create shared and array formulas, etc.)
* Format cells (set cell font, colors, alignment, borders, number format, etc.)
* Export the workbook to PDF
* Print the workbook
